<p> 
These pages are designed as
a reference for the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
Unlike the IETF FTP specifications,
these pages describe
how FTP actually works (and doesn't work) in practice.
Let me know if you encounter
any interoperability problems not described here.

Exception:
I have not attempted to describe the behavior of obsolete servers
whose pathnames don't follow the UNIX slash conventions
assumed by web browsers.
It is the server's responsibility
to translate between local pathnames and slashed pathnames.</p>
